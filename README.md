## üß† Motivation behind Developing this Application

To overcome the old traditional way of promoting the events conducted by [**GDSC GMRIT Chapter**](https://gdsc.community.dev/gmr-institute-of-technology-razam/), we thought of promoting in a different and unique way and finally came up with a solution i.e., To develop an app, which will be handy to users, and also helps our community members to become interative with us. With an app, we can easily reach hundreds of students with just a single notification and also helps them to attend events seamlessly with hassle-free experience. 


## GDSC GMRIT Connect

An android application developed specifically for students and community members which helps to interact and get notified about the events. It also helps make the RSVP easier where it directly redirects to the Event Page in the GDSC Community Dev Platform. It also helps the students to know more about our chapter and about Google Developer Student Clubs, and become a member with us. The User Interface is designed in such a way it motivates students and community members.
